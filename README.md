## Project Description:
Utilize Power Query Editor in Excel to clean and standardize an Audible dataset. Tasks include formatting columns, ensuring data consistency, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

### Questions:
- Standardize the name column to ensure consistent title casing.
- Separate combined first and last names in the author column if they are currently combined.
- Ensure all entries in the releasedate column follow a consistent date format (DD-MM-YYYY).
- Convert the time column from text format to a duration format that Excel recognizes.
- Ensure the price column is in a numeric format, and identify any non-numeric values.
- Convert text ratings in the stars column to numeric values.
- Split the narratedby column into multiple columns if multiple narrators are listed.
- Merge the releasedate and language columns into a single new column named releaseinfo with the format "DD-MM-YYYY, Language."
- Ensure all currency values in the price column are formatted consistently with two decimal places.
